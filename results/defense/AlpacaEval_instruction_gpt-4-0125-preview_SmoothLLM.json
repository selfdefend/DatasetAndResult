			"target model response": "Feeling tired or sleepy in warm environments is a common experience, and there are several reasons why warmth can make you feel tired:\n\n1. **Regulation of Body Temperature**: Your body works hard to maintain a stable internal temperature. When the environment is warm, your body needs to dissipate excess heat to maintain this balance. This process requires energy and increases blood flow to the skin, potentially diverting blood from the brain, which can lead to feelings of tiredness.\n\n2. **Vasodilation**: In response to heat, your blood vessels, especially those near the skin, expand in a process called vasodilation. This helps",

It is particularly useful for problems involving complex geometries, loadings, and material properties where analytical solutions cannot be easily obtained. FEM divides a large problem into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements. The original structure is modeled as an assembly of these elements, which are interconnected at points called nodes. The method approximates the unknown function over the domain by a piecewise function composed of a set of polynomial basis functions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the Finite Element Method:\n\n### 1",

			"target model response": "Forming a new habit effectively involves a combination of strategies tailored to individual preferences and circumstances. However, research and expert advice converge on several key steps that can significantly increase your chances of success. Here's a comprehensive approach:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Begin with a habit that is so easy you can't say no to it. This makes it easier to stay consistent. For example, if you want to start exercising, aim for just five minutes a day at the start.\n\n2. **Be Specific**: Define your habit with as much specificity as possible. Instead of saying \"I will drink more water,\" say \"I will drink one glass",

Since Braille characters are typically used for text, creating images requires a bit of creativity. We'll use the Braille alphabet to form a simple shape.

For simplicity, let's create a basic shape of a house, which can be easier to design with the limitations of Braille characters.\n\nHere's a simple representation of a house using Braille characters.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
